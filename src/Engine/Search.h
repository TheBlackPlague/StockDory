            // causes the search to take longer to complete; a consequence of destructive interference.
            //
            // Constructive interference happens when one task provides a transposition table entry that another task
            // is about to read - this allows the task to read the entry and use it to speed through certain branches by
            // returning directly from the transposition table if possible. Where this isn't possible, the task can use
            // the entry's evaluation as the static evaluation for that branch, enabling certain pruning techniques and
            // disabling others, once again widening the search space explored by the task. Furthermore, the provided
            // entry's move can be used to speed through the branch since the move policy ensures that the move is
            // the first move in the move list. This can allow the search for that branch to complete much faster,
            // overall reducing the search time, mitigating the destructive interference's negative impact on the
            // search time.
            //
            // Together, the search space is considerably widened, making the search more accurate, while the search
            // time remains relatively the same on average. This leads the engine to find better moves in the same
            // amount of time and avoid some pitfalls of the heuristical pruning, reduction, and search techniques used
